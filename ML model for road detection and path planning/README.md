# Key Components
a) Road Segmentation Model (Perception)
Input: RGB image (e.g., 256x256)

Output: Road mask (binary segmentation)

Model: U-Net with EfficientNet-B3 backbone

Loss Function: Dice Loss + Binary Cross-Entropy

Training Data:

Synthetic datasets (CARLA, AirSim)

Real-world road images with masks (Mapillary Vistas)

b) Path Planning
Input: Road mask from segmentation

Process:

Identify road centerline using morphological thinning

Calculate target waypoint 20m ahead

Compute deviation from drone center

Output: Target coordinates (x, y) in drone frame

c) Control System
Input: Target coordinates

Controller: PID for lateral movement, fixed forward velocity

Output:

Yaw rate: Kp * lateral_error + Kd * d(lateral_error)/dt

Pitch: Constant forward velocity

Throttle: Altitude hold via barometer

# Training and implementation:

Phase 1: Perception Training

Use transfer learning with pre-trained EfficientNet

Train on synthetic data first (50k images)

Fine-tune on real-world data (10k images)

Augmentations: random brightness, rotation, perspective warp

Phase 2: Simulation Testing

Test in AirSim/CARLA with various scenarios:

Straight roads

Intersections

Occluded roads

Different lighting conditions

Phase 3: Real-world Deployment

Start with low-altitude flights (5-10m)

Use RTK-GPS for ground truth validation

Implement fail-safe mechanisms:

Return-to-home on signal loss

Obstacle avoidance via LiDAR


# Key enhancements:

Temporal Consistency: Use LSTM to process video sequences

Sensor Fusion: Integrate IMU for motion stabilization

Edge Optimization: Quantize model for onboard deployment

Uncertainty Estimation: Monte Carlo dropout for confidence maps
